The purpose of the code analysis is to use Deep Learning methodoligy to predict the market price of Bitcoin based on market sentiment.

One method of predicting the market price of Bitcoin will be to create a deep learning model based on historical closing prices and extrapolate the future value. This analysis can be found in the repository on the following path: jmazzuca92/deep-learning/Starter_Code/lstm_stock_predictor_closing.ipynb.

Our other method of analysis to predict the future market price of Bitcoin by creating a predicting model based on the information derived from the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG). This indicator can be though of the Volatility Index (VIX) common equity traders are accustomed to gauge the sentiment of US publicly traded equities.

From the models executed, the following conclusions can be made:

1. The model created based on closing prices of Bitcoin yield less losses.
2. The actual price of Bitcoin is better predicted from the closing data.
3. The window size that works best for the closing price model is 1.
